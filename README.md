Fashion Blog Predictor Model
This repository contains the Fashion Blog Predictor Model project, which aims to predict the success of fashion blog posts using machine learning techniques.

Project Overview
The project includes:

Logistic Regression Baseline Model: Establishes a starting point for prediction accuracy.
Support Vector Machine (SVM) Model: Serves as the target model for improved accuracy.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Utilizes GridSearchCV to fine-tune the model parameters for better performance.
Components
Logistic Regression Model: A baseline model to predict the success of blog posts.
Support Vector Machine (SVM) Model: A more advanced model aimed at achieving higher prediction accuracy.
GridSearchCV: Used for hyperparameter tuning to optimize the performance of the SVM model.
Contributions
The logistic regression baseline model, support vector machine model, and hyperparameter tuning were completed by Sean W. Ryan.
The remainder of the project was collaboratively completed with my partner, Janna Foy.
Requirements
To run the project, you need the following Python libraries:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib (if there are visualizations)
You can install the required libraries using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
How to Run
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone [repository link]
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd FashionBlogPredictorModel
Open the Jupyter Notebook:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook FashionBlogPredictorModel.ipynb
Usage
Follow the steps in the Jupyter Notebook to load the dataset, preprocess the data, build and evaluate the models, and perform hyperparameter tuning.

Results
The project demonstrates the improvement in prediction accuracy achieved through hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
